If you are in the habit of creating [small containers for your go apps](https://joeshaw.org/smaller-docker-containers-for-go-apps/) 
instead of relaying on a full fledge OS you've come to rely on busybox or scratch as your base image. The issue with this images is the fact
that they do not provide the root CA certificates needed for an application that needs to talk to an SSL backend or site. You will get the following error: `x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided`.
I came across an [article by Ben Whaley](http://blog.bwhaley.com/ca-certificates-for-docker-busybox-containers) 
where he provides a solution for this issue. However I run into a situation when in EL systems `/etc/ssl/certs/` is actually a symlink to `/etc/pki` 
and because the container doesn't have access to `/etc/pki`. The solution to this is to mount both inside the container like this:

```
docker run -d -v /etc/pki:/etc/pki -v /etc/ssl/certs/:/etc/ssl/certs <image>
```

This will make it so your go apps have access to the certificates
